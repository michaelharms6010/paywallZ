# paywallZ

Aiming to create an easy-to-implement paywall (for static websites for now, building towards an npm package)

## Todo

Testing - once my node is synced i will test
Deployment - Needs to be tailored to protecting wordpress content
Build into a react / node companion package - maybe make into an easy to implement service?? (desite its unscalability)
Build into memo-reliant functionality (probably a bad idea until wallet support makes it easy)

Timeout Notifications
Session persistance testing
