# Node/Express BE Template

Just a nice template for starting new projects from scratch with prebuilt JWT authentication. Got sick of doing this over and over

## Todo

Testing - once my node is synced i will test
Deployment - Needs to be tailored to protecting wordpress content
Build into a react / node companion package - maybe make into an easy to implement service?? (desite its unscalability)
Build into memo-reliant functionality (probably a bad idea until wallet support makes it easy)
